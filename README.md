### Asides

* [Halcyon](https://halcyon.sh/) - A system for installing Haskell apps and development tools, including GHC and Cabal
  * This project is not updated in a long time (more than 2 years) and it's instalation script is not flexible enough and seems outdated. I'm not recommending this at the moment.
